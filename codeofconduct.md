# Member Expectations

Our goal is that GARDEN members can do and publish science with GARDEN data in a way that is both open to collaboration and respects the effort of collaboration members, especially junior members. If situations arise which are not explicitly covered here, they will be decided by the Steering Committee in accordance with these principles.
All GARDEN members are required to agree to this policy document annually via a Google form. There will be a 1 (one) week period for public comments from collaboration members.
This document can be summed up by the following: every member is expected to treat others the way they want to be treated, with civility and respect.
All collaboration members are encouraged to complete inclusion, diversity, equity, and access training, such as those provided by many institutions.

## Roles and Duties

Principal Investigator (PI): Susan Kassin<br>
Survey Manager (SM): Camilla Pacifici<br>
Steering Committee (SC) (garden_steering AT maillist.stsci.edu): PI, SM, Mia Bovill, Christopher Willmer, Benjamin Weiner, Mauro Giavalisco

# Publication Policy

All members of the GARDEN team must acknowledge and abide by the following publication policy.  This policy will be enforced for 1 (one) year from any given data release. 

* New paper ideas must be proposed via Google Slides before significant work is undertaken. Before proposing or developing a new scientific project, members should consult the slides to prevent duplication of effort. The slide for a proposal must include the following: 
  * The topic of the paper.
  * Which specific data products and/or software are needed.
  * Which members of GARDEN are involved and which external people are involved.
  * Whether the lead is a student or postdoc and whether this work forms part of a PhD thesis, Masters thesis, or a component of a PhD program.
* GARDEN members can sign up to be lead or collaborator on proposed science ideas by adding their name to  the relevant Google Slide.
* Proposed new science projects with no conflicts will be approved by default. 
* Proposed new science projects which may conflict with an existing one will be discussed with all the members involved and the PI and/or SM. The decision of the PI and SM will be final.
* The status of paper(s) resulting from an approved proposed science project, including a link to the Overleaf draft(s), must be included on the slide.
* Both new and on-going science projects and ideas will be presented or discussed in a virtual meeting every Friday at noon US eastern time. All GARDEN members are welcomed. Priority will be given to projects which are close to completion and to newly proposed projects.
* Each team member with Builder status can claim leadership of up to 2 (two) papers.  If no work is done after 1 (one) year for junior members and 6 (six) months for senior members, the science idea will revert to unclaimed status, unless prior arrangements have been made with the PI and SM.
* Each team member without Builder status can claim leadership of up to 1 (one) paper. If no work is done after 6 (six) months for junior members and 3 (three) months for senior members, the science idea will revert to unclaimed status, unless prior arrangements have been made with the PI and SM.
* Once a paper is in its final stages, it will be circulated to the full team for comments and the team will have 2 (two) weeks to comment/contribute and request authorship. 
* If a member knowingly scoops the work of another member, they will be reported to the Steering Committee.

## Authorship Policy

Authorship on all papers within GARDEN must be offered to members with Builder status. The full list, including email addresses and ORCID’s is included in the linked Google spreadsheet. Required authors are to be added in the order provided in the spreadsheet immediately after individuals who contributed significantly to that specific paper.  This order may need to be different for some papers where Builders contributed additional work, and if so the authors should contact the PI and SM for advice.

Any collaboration member who creates a data product and shares it with the wider collaboration must be offered authorship on any paper resulting from that data product. 

The full list of team members, including emails, affiliations and specific expertise is included in the linked Google spreadsheet above. 

In addition, all papers must include acknowledgements to the following resources using the language below (an Overleaf template will be circulated): 
* Facilities: JWST (NIRCam, NIRSpec), MAST, HST (ACS, WFC3)
* The list of facilities should reflect what is used for the specific project.
* Software: Matplotlib, Astropy, TOPCAT, SAOimage DS9 
* The list of software should reflect what is used for the specific project.
* JWST grant: “This work is based [in part] on observations made with the NASA/ESA/CSA JWST. The data were obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-03127 for JWST. These observations are associated with the program JWST-GO2123. Support for program JWST-GO2123 was provided by NASA through grant W1NBN156CYF9.”
* The JHU Rockfish Cluster: “This work was carried out in part at the Advanced Research Computing at Hopkins (ARCH) core facility (rockfish.jhu.edu), which is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant number OAC1920103.”

### Survey Paper Policy

Survey papers will be decided by the Steering Committee. All current collaboration members will be included as authors on survey papers unless they explicitly opt-out. 

## Rapid Publication Policy

Authors should contact the Steering Committee if they believe they have a project which may require rapid publication. This should be done before significant work is completed on the paper. If the Steering Committee agrees to the rapid publication, the authors should send an email to the collaboration notifying them of the paper. 
Given the nature of the raw data obtained by GARDEN, with no proprietary time, if any analyses produce unique and potentially high impact results that merit a short-track publication, the following special policy will be applicable. 
The comment period for the collaboration will be reduced from 2 (two) weeks to 1 (one) week.
All members of the collaboration will be co-authors on the publication, unless someone  explicitly opts-out of authorship. In case a collaborator wants to opt-out of a publication, the collaborator must notify the lead author and the Steering Committee.

# Code of Conduct

All members of GARDEN agree to abide by the [AAS Code of Conduct](https://astronautical.org/aas-code-of-conduct/) and the [AAS Code of Ethics](https://aas.org/policies/ethics). 

In addition, during all in person and virtual meetings, they agree to abide by the following (modified from the STScI Code of Conduct for meeting rooms):
* All participants in the meeting will conduct themselves in a professional manner that is welcoming and inclusive to all participants and free from any form of disrespect, intimidation, bullying, discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.
* Participants will treat each other with civility and respect to create a collegial and professional environment where all voices and perspectives can be heard irrespective of biases, known and unknown. Creating a supporting environment is a responsibility of all participants.
* Participants will avoid inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, educational background, occupation, seniority or any other characteristic protected by law.
* Senior members accept additional responsibility to ensure that conduct is appropriate.

## Consequences for Violation of Collaboration Policies (i.e., this document)

If behavior in violation of these Collaboration Policies occurs, members of the collaboration may report it to the Steering Committee, or via an [anonymous Google form](https://forms.gle/6Tx4xp6oLQ5hzbg26). The Steering Committee will investigate all reported issues to determine if a violation of the Collaboration Policies has occurred. If a member has been determined to have violated the Collaboration Policies, the Steering Committee will discuss possible consequences.

The Steering Committee will review the Collaboration Policies once a year, or as needed, and make any modifications which are deemed necessary. Any time this Collaboration Policies document is modified, the collaboration will be notified by e-mail with a link to the updated Collaboration Policies.
